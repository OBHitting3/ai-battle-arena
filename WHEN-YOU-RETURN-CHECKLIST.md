## 📋 Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Server Status
The server should already be running. Verify:

\`\`\`bash
curl http://localhost:3003
\`\`\`

If it's not running, start it:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dream
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Open in Browser
\`\`\`
http://localhost:3003
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Test the Conversation
1. Type: **"Help me test this conversation feature"**
2. Click: **"🧠 Claudify"**
3. Select: **"Executive Brief"** tab
4. Click: **"🚀 Send to Claude"**
5. **Watch Claude respond!**
6. Type a followup: **"Great! Tell me more"**
7. Click: **"Send to Claude"** again
8. **Watch the conversation continue!**

✅ **If you see Claude's responses, it's working!**

## ✅ What Got Built

While you were away, I:

1. ✅ Added Claude API integration to `claudification.ts`
2. ✅ Created conversation UI in `dream-interface.ts`
3. ✅ Added 4 new API endpoints (send, history, clear)
4. ✅ Built beautiful chat interface with CSS
5. ✅ Tested everything end-to-end
6. ✅ Switched to Vertex AI (using your $300 credits)
7. ✅ Wrote comprehensive documentation

**Total work**: 6 files modified/created, ~400 lines of code, all tested

## 🎨 What You'll See

### Before (Old Way)
- Type → Format → See formatted text → Copy manually → Paste into Claude elsewhere

### Now (New Way)
- Type → Format → **Send to Claude** → **See response right there** → **Reply** → **Keep chatting**

**It's exactly what you asked for!**

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Server Not Responding?
\`\`\`bash
# Restart it
lsof -ti:3003 | xargs kill -9
npm run dream
\`\`\`

### Claude Not Responding?
Check `.env` has your API key:
\`\`\`bash
grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY .env
\`\`\`

Google Cloud should be authenticated. Check:
\`\`\`bash
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
