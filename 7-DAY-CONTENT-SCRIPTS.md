## DAY 2 (48 Hours After Launch)
### "Former IRS Agent Makes $4,200/Month with ChatGPT (Copy This)"

**Duration**: 9 minutes
**Target**: Former financial/tax professionals
**Hook Score**: 88/100

#### [00:00 - 00:20] HOOK
**[VISUAL: Earnings dashboard showing $4,200]**

"This is Jennifer's Stripe dashboard. $4,200 this month. Last month: $3,800. The month before: $2,100.

Six months ago, she was an IRS agent making $68,000 a year.

Then DOGE laid her off.

Now she works 15 hours a week from her kitchen table, using nothing but ChatGPT and a Google account."

#### [00:20 - 01:45] THE STORY
"Jennifer spent 12 years at the IRS. Tax code specialist. The kind of person who could recite IRC sections in her sleep.

When the layoff notice came, she did what everyone does: LinkedIn, Indeed, USAJOBS. Three months of applications. Two interviews. Zero offers.

Then she saw something that changed everything.

A small business owner posted on Facebook: 'Does anyone know how to set up bookkeeping for an LLC? I can't afford a CPA.'

Jennifer's first thought: 'I could do that in 20 minutes.'

Her second thought: 'Wait... could I CHARGE for that?'

She replied to the post. Offered to help for $200.

The business owner said yes immediately.

That was 6 months ago. She now has 8 retainer clients at $500-800/month."

#### [01:45 - 03:30] THE SERVICE
"Here's exactly what Jennifer sells:

**Monthly AI Bookkeeping & Tax Prep Support** - $500-$800/month per client

What she does:
1. Client sends her receipts/invoices via email or Google Drive
2. She uses ChatGPT to categorize expenses (takes 10 minutes)
3. She uses AI to flag potential deductions the client missed
4. She creates a monthly financial summary report
5. She gives tax-saving recommendations

**Total time per client**: 2-3 hours per month
**Total monthly income**: $4,200 (8 clients Ã— $525 average)
**Effective hourly rate**: $150-200/hour

Compare that to her IRS salary:
- $68,000/year = $32/hour
- Now: $4,200/month Ã— 12 = $50,400/year working 15 hours/week
- On track for $75,000/year by month 12"

#### [03:30 - 06:15] HOW TO COPY THIS (Step-by-Step)

**STEP 1: Define Your Offer** (Exactly what Jennifer did)

**Service Name**: Monthly Financial Health Check for Small Businesses

**What's Included**:
- Expense categorization & review
- Potential tax deduction identification
- Monthly financial summary (1-page PDF)
- Quarterly tax planning call (15 min)
- Unlimited email questions

**Price**: $500/month (first 3 clients get $350 intro rate)

**STEP 2: Set Up Your Tools** (Total cost: $20/month)

- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month (need GPT-4 for accuracy)
- Google Workspace: Free (Drive + Sheets)
- Canva: Free (for reports)
- Wave Accounting: Free (optional, for visualization)

**STEP 3: Create Your ChatGPT Prompts**

Jennifer uses these EXACT prompts:

**Prompt 1 - Expense Categorization**:
```
You are a CPA specializing in small business bookkeeping. I will provide a list of expenses. For each expense:

1. Categorize it (Office Supplies, Travel, Marketing, etc.)
2. Flag if it's 100% deductible, partially deductible, or not deductible
3. Note any documentation required for audit protection
4. Suggest if there's a better way to structure this expense for tax purposes

Here are this month's expenses:
[paste client's expense list]
```

**Prompt 2 - Tax Deduction Finder**:
```
Based on these business expenses and this industry [client's industry], what common tax deductions might this business be missing? Provide:

1. List of commonly missed deductions for [industry]
2. Which ones apply based on their current spending
3. Estimated tax savings for each
4. What documentation they need to start claiming these

Be specific and conservative in estimates.
```

**Prompt 3 - Monthly Summary Report**:
```
Create a one-page executive summary for a small business owner with the following:

Revenue this month: $X
Expenses this month: $Y
Profit margin: Z%
Top 3 expense categories:
Tax savings identified: $X
Action items for next month:

Make it easy to understand for someone without financial background. Use simple language.
```

**STEP 4: Find Your First Client** (3 strategies)

**Strategy A - Facebook Groups** (Fastest):
1. Join "Small Business Owners [Your City]"
2. Join "[Your State] Entrepreneurs"
3. Join industry-specific groups (restaurants, gyms, salons)
4. Post: "Former IRS agent offering discounted bookkeeping help to 3 small businesses. I use AI to keep costs low. $350/month instead of my usual $500. DM if interested."

**Strategy B - LinkedIn Outreach**:
1. Search "small business owner [your city]"
2. Filter for 2nd connections
3. Send personalized message:

"Hi [Name],

I noticed you run [Business Name]. Congrats on [specific achievement you saw on their profile].

Quick question: Are you handling your own bookkeeping, or do you have a CPA?

I'm a former IRS agent now offering fractional CFO services to small businesses. I use AI to keep my rates affordable ($500/month vs the $2,500+ CPAs charge).

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to see if it's a fit?

Best,
[Your Name]"

**Strategy C - Upwork/Fiverr** (Build credibility):
1. Create profile: "Former IRS Agent | AI-Powered Bookkeeping for Small Business"
2. Set rate at $40/hour (temporarily, to get first reviews)
3. Apply to 10 jobs per day
4. After 3-5 good reviews, transition clients to retainer model

**STEP 5: Deliver Like a Pro**

Jennifer's process:
- Client sends expenses by 5th of each month
- She processes everything on the 10th (batch processing = efficiency)
- Sends report by 15th
- Quarterly call scheduled in advance

She uses Calendly (free) for scheduling and Stripe (2.9% fee) for payments.

Total setup time: 3 hours
First client landed: Within 7 days
Time to $4,000/month: 4 months

#### [06:15 - 07:45] WHO CAN DO THIS?

You can copy this model if you have experience in:

**Perfect Fit**:
- IRS / Tax agency experience
- Accounting background (government or private)
- Budget analyst roles
- Financial management positions
- Auditor experience

**Can Learn & Do It**:
- Any analytical government role
- If you've managed budgets in your job
- If you understand basic P&L statements
- If you're comfortable with numbers

**NOT Required**:
- CPA license (you're not doing tax returns, just bookkeeping)
- Accounting degree
- Expensive software

**Legal Note**: You're offering bookkeeping and financial organization, NOT tax preparation or CPA services. Make this clear to clients. When they need actual tax filing, refer them to a CPA (some CPAs will pay you referral fees).

#### [07:45 - 09:00] JENNIFER'S ADVICE (Interview Format)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - you and Jennifer on video call]**

"I asked Jennifer what she'd tell someone starting today. Here's what she said:

'Don't wait until you feel ready. I didn't know what I was doing when I got that first client. I figured it out.

The hardest part isn't the workâ€”it's believing your government experience has value in the market. It does.

Start with ONE client. Charge less than you're worth just to get the testimonial. Then raise your rates.

I went from $200 for my first client to $800/month for my eighth client. Same service. I just got confident.

Also, ChatGPT makes mistakes. Always review its output. You're not replacing your expertise, you're augmenting it. The AI does the tedious categorization; you do the strategic thinking.

If I can do this, anyone can. I was terrified. I'd never run a business. Never had clients. Never invoiced anyone.

But I'd also never been this free. This in control of my income. This... happy.'

**[Back to you on camera]**

That's it. That's the model.

If you want Jennifer's exact client contract template, her onboarding checklist, and her ChatGPT prompts in a Google Doc, I put it all in a free guide.

Link in the description. No email required. Just take it and use it.

And if you're starting this, comment below 'I'm in.' I want to follow your progress.

Let's go."

## DAY 4 (96 Hours)
### "DOGE Layoff Financial Survival: 72-Hour Action Plan"

**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Target**: People in immediate financial stress
**Hook Score**: 87/100 (high urgency)

#### [00:00 - 00:18] HOOK
"You just got laid off. Your last paycheck clears in 2 weeks. You have $3,400 in checking and $8,200 in savings.

This video is your 72-hour financial survival plan to avoid panic decisions and buy yourself runway to build income."

#### [00:18 - 01:30] HOUR 1-6: STOP THE BLEEDING

**[VISUAL: Checklist appearing on screen]**

"First 6 hours after layoff. Your brain is in panic mode. Here's what to do BEFORE you do anything else.

**1. File for unemployment IMMEDIATELY** (Do this TODAY)
- Don't wait
- Even if you think you won't need it
- Even if you have savings
- Processing takes 2-4 weeks
- You're leaving $400-$600/week on the table if you delay

Where to file:
- Google '[your state] unemployment benefits'
- You'll need: Last pay stub, employer info, SSN
- Takes 30 minutes

**2. Freeze all non-essential spending** (Next 2 hours)
- Cancel subscriptions you don't need (Netflix, gym, etc.)
- Pause any automatic investments
- Call credit card companies - ask for hardship programs (lower rates, skip a payment)
- Don't cancel insurance - worst time to be uninsured

Use this spreadsheet [link in description]:
- Column 1: All monthly expenses
- Column 2: Essential (rent, food, utilities)
- Column 3: Non-essential (everything else)
- Pause Column 3 immediately

**3. Calculate your runway** (Next 1 hour)
- Total savings: $________
- Monthly essential expenses: $________
- Divide: ________ months of runway
- This is how long you have to replace income

Example:
- $11,600 total savings
- $2,900/month essential expenses
- = 4 months runway

**4. Do NOT touch retirement accounts**
- Early withdrawal = 10% penalty + taxes
- $20K withdrawal becomes $13K after penalties
- Only as LAST resort

**5. Talk to your family TODAY**
- Financial stress destroys relationships when hidden
- Have the honest conversation now
- Get everyone on the same page
- Kids don't need details, but spouse does

---

#### [01:30 - 03:45] HOUR 6-24: MAXIMIZE SEVERANCE & BENEFITS

**What to negotiate** (even if they say it's non-negotiable):

**Severance Package**:
- Ask for: 2 weeks pay per year of service (minimum)
- If they offer 1 week per year, counter with: 'I understand budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at 1.5 weeks per year, or alternatively, extend my health benefits for an additional 3 months?'
- They can often be flexible on health benefits even if cash is fixed

**Extended Health Insurance**:
- COBRA is expensive ($600-$1,200/month)
- Ask: 'Can the agency cover COBRA for 3-6 months as part of severance?'
- Or: 'Can I remain on the payroll for 60 days to extend insurance?'

**Accrued Leave Payout**:
- Federal employees: You WILL get paid for unused annual leave
- Make sure this is included in final paycheck
- Verify the amount is correct

**Unused Sick Leave**:
- Can't be paid out, BUT
- If you get another federal job, it transfers
- Document your balance

**Letter of Recommendation**:
- Ask your supervisor for this BEFORE you leave
- Much harder to get later
- Ask for LinkedIn recommendation too

**References**:
- Identify 3 people who will give strong references
- Ask them NOW while you're still top-of-mind
- Get their personal email/phone (not just gov't email)

**Access to Equipment**:
- Ask if you can purchase your laptop at fair market value
- Saves you $500-$1,000 if you're starting a business

**Timeline for negotiation**:
- You typically have 3-7 days to review severance offer
- Don't sign immediately
- Ask: 'Can I have until [3 days from now] to review this?'
- Consult with employment lawyer if severance is over $10K (worth the $300 consultation fee)

---

#### [05:30 - 07:15] HOUR 48-72: PROTECT YOUR CREDIT & NEGOTIATE BILLS

**Call these companies (use this script):**

**Credit Cards**:
"Hi, I recently lost my job due to government layoffs. I've been a customer for [X] years and always paid on time. I want to continue paying, but I need help. Do you have any hardship programs that could lower my interest rate or let me skip a payment?"

Result: Many will reduce APR from 22% to 0-9% for 6-12 months

**Mortgage/Rent**:
**Mortgage**: Call your lender, ask about forbearance options (pause payments for 3-6 months)
**Rent**: Talk to landlord BEFORE you miss a payment. Offer partial payment plan.

Script: "I lost my job but I'm actively working on replacing income. I can pay $X this month instead of $Y. Can we work out a plan for the next 2-3 months?"

**Car Payment**:
Call lender, ask about:
- Deferment (skip 1-2 payments, added to end of loan)
- Refinance to lower monthly payment
- Extension of loan term

**Utilities**:
- Most utility companies have assistance programs
- Google '[your utility company] + low income assistance'
- You may qualify for reduced rates

**Student Loans**:
- Federal loans: File for income-driven repayment (payment could go to $0)
- Private loans: Ask about forbearance

**Insurance**:
- Call and ask for lower rates
- Increase deductibles to reduce monthly premium
- Shop competitors (can save $30-$100/month)

**Target savings from negotiations**: $300-$800/month

---

#### [07:15 - 08:45] DAY 4-7: BUILD YOUR INCOME PLAN

You now have:
- âœ… Unemployment filed
- âœ… Expenses cut
- âœ… Runway calculated
- âœ… Severance negotiated
- âœ… Emergency income flowing
- âœ… Bills negotiated

Now: Focus on REAL income replacement.

**Two-track approach:**

**Track 1: Job Search** (if you want traditional employment)
- Update resume (use ChatGPT to rewrite in private sector language)
- LinkedIn optimization
- Apply to 5-10 jobs per day
- Network (tell everyone you're looking)

**Track 2: AI Income Stream** (even if you want a job, do this as backup)
- Pick ONE service from my Day 3 video
- Set up tools (3 hours)
- Reach out to 20 potential clients (2 hours)
- Land first client (1-2 weeks)

**Why both tracks?**
- Jobs take 2-6 months to land
- AI income can start in 1-2 weeks
- If you land a job, you can do AI work on side
- If AI income hits $5K/month, maybe you DON'T want a job

**Goal by end of week 1:**
- Emergency income: $500-$1,000 (gig work + selling items)
- Unemployment: Filed (money comes in week 3-4)
- Bills: Negotiated down by $300-$800/month
- First AI client: Outreach started

#### [08:45 - 09:45] THE PSYCHOLOGY PART (This Matters Most)

**[VISUAL: You speaking directly to camera, no graphics]**

"Here's what nobody tells you about getting laid off:

The financial part is solvable. You just saw the playbook.

The HARD part is the identity crisis.

For years, you've been 'a federal employee.' That was PART of who you are.

Now you're... what? Unemployed? A freelancer? A business owner?

It feels like falling.

Here's what I want you to know:

**1. This is not a referendum on your value.**
You didn't get laid off because you weren't good enough. You got laid off because of politics and budget cuts. Those have nothing to do with your abilities.

**2. Your skills are MORE valuable outside government.**
You've been underpaid for years. The private market will pay you more for the same skills. I've seen it happen over and over.

**3. This might be the best thing that ever happened to you.**
I know that sounds crazy right now. But six months from now, some of you will be making MORE money, with MORE freedom, and you'll think 'I should have left years ago.'

**4. You're not starting over. You're building on 10-20 years of experience.**
You have a foundation most entrepreneurs would kill for. You just need to repackage it.

**5. Community matters.**
Drop a comment if you're going through this. Find others in the same situation. You're not alone.

I'm creating a Discord for laid-off federal workers helping each other build AI income streams. Link in description. Free. No sales pitch. Just community.

You've got this."
