## Recommendation

Based on the "Golden Universal" goal of appealing to ALL demographics:

**Start with Variation 3 (Universal Friendly)**
- Most accessible
- Friendliest personality
- Largest fonts for readability
- Clearest language
- Best for widest audience

Then offer Variation 1 and 2 as "style preferences" after signup:
- "Prefer a more exciting look? Switch to Bold Energy!"
- "Prefer a calmer experience? Switch to Luxury Calm!"

This way you can appeal to everyone while still letting users customize based on their personal preference.
