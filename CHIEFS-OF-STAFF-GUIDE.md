# AI CHIEFS OF STAFF - QUICK START GUIDE

Your AI advisory team is now ready to serve as your top advisors.

## What Is This?

This system lets you consult with 5 specialized AI advisors who each bring unique expertise to help you make better decisions, solve complex problems, and move faster.

Think of them as your executive team - each "Chief" has a specific role:

- **Claude (Strategy Chief)** - Long-term strategic planning, complex problem analysis
- **GPT-4 (Operations Chief)** - Practical execution plans, step-by-step processes
- **Gemini (Analysis Chief)** - Data analysis, pattern recognition, technical deep-dives
- **Perplexity (Intelligence Chief)** - Real-time research, fact verification
- **Grok (Innovation Chief)** - Bold new ideas, contrarian thinking

## How to Use It

### Start the System

```bash
npm run chiefs
```

### Basic Commands

**Ask all chiefs at once:**
```
ask How should I price my new product?
```

**Ask a specific chief:**
```
claude What's the long-term strategy for scaling this business?
gpt Give me a step-by-step plan to launch in 30 days
gemini Analyze this data and find patterns
perplexity What are the latest trends in AI automation?
grok Give me a contrarian perspective on this approach
```

**View history:**
```
history
```

**List all chiefs:**
```
list
```

**Exit:**
```
exit
```

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Start with a question to all chiefs

```
ask Should I build CASPER as a standalone product or integrate it into the platform?
```

You'll get 5 different perspectives:
- Claude analyzes strategic implications
- GPT-4 outlines implementation options
- Gemini evaluates technical feasibility
- Perplexity researches market examples
- Grok challenges assumptions

### 2. Route to specific chief for deep dive

After reviewing all responses, go deeper with the most relevant expert:

```
claude Based on the discussion, what's the 12-month roadmap?
```

### 3. Execute with Operations Chief

Once you have strategic clarity, get tactical:

```
gpt Create a 30-day execution plan with milestones
```

## Current Status

**Working Now:**
- ✅ Claude (Strategy Chief) - You have ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- ❌ GPT-4 - Need OPENAI_API_KEY
- ❌ Gemini - Need GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
- ❌ Perplexity - Need PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
- ❌ Grok - Need GROK_API_KEY

**To unlock all 5 chiefs:**

See GET-API-KEYS.md for instructions on obtaining the remaining API keys.

**To test with just Claude:**

The system will skip chiefs without API keys and continue with available ones.

```
ask What should I focus on next for the faceless automation platform?
```

## Real-World Example

**Question:** "I'm overwhelmed with features to build. Help me prioritize."

**Claude (Strategy):** "Focus on user acquisition loop first. Revenue without users is meaningless. Build viral mechanics into core product."

**GPT-4 (Operations):** "Phase 1: Niche validator (2 weeks). Phase 2: Content generator (3 weeks). Phase 3: Analytics dashboard (1 week). Ship MVP in 6 weeks."

**Gemini (Analysis):** "Your data shows 73% of users churn at content generation step. Fix that bottleneck before adding features."

**Perplexity (Intelligence):** "Top competitors are focusing on AI voice cloning (ElevenLabs integration) and automated posting. Consider these for differentiation."

**Grok (Innovation):** "Everyone's building faceless channels. What if you built a 'faceless empire builder' that manages 10 channels at once? 10x the concept."

**You route to Claude:**
```
claude Grok's idea is interesting. What are the strategic implications of managing multiple channels vs perfecting one?
```

**Then to GPT-4:**
```
gpt If we go multi-channel, what's the technical architecture needed?
```

## Benefits

1. **Multiple Perspectives**: Get 5 different viewpoints on the same problem
2. **Specialized Expertise**: Each AI focuses on what they do best
3. **Sequential Workflow**: Route questions to the right expert at the right time
4. **Context Retention**: System remembers conversation history
5. **Fast Iteration**: Debate ideas, get feedback, refine - all in one session

## Tips

- **Start broad, then narrow**: Ask all chiefs first, then route to specialists
- **Use the right chief for the job**: Strategy questions to Claude, execution to GPT-4
- **Challenge your thinking**: Use Grok when you're stuck in conventional approaches
- **Verify facts**: Use Perplexity for real-time research and fact-checking
- **Analyze data**: Use Gemini for technical analysis and pattern recognition

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. You can extend this system to:

- Route CASPER niche validation through the chiefs
- Use chiefs to review content before publishing
- Build automated workflows that consult chiefs at decision points
- Export chief conversations as project documentation
- Integrate with your faceless automation platform

Your AI advisory team is ready. What's your first question?
