# THE PERFECT TEST QUESTION FOR ALL 5 CHIEFS

## Test Question

**"I'm building a faceless YouTube automation platform that generates AI content at scale. I need to decide between two business models:**

1. **SaaS subscription** ($99/month, users create unlimited videos)
2. **Revenue share model** (30% platform fee, we handle everything, users get 70%)

**Which model should I pursue first, and what are the critical success factors I'm missing?"**

---

## Why This Question is Perfect

### ‚úÖ Tests ALL 5 APIs
- Each chief must respond with their unique perspective
- Verifies API connection and response handling
- Shows distinct thinking styles

### ‚úÖ Leverages Each Chief's Strengths

**üß† Claude (Strategy Chief)** will provide:
- Long-term strategic analysis
- Ethical considerations of business models
- System-level thinking about market positioning
- Hidden trade-offs between models
- Contrarian viewpoints on assumptions

**‚öôÔ∏è GPT-5 (Operations Chief)** will provide:
- Step-by-step execution plan for each model
- Resource requirements and constraints
- Practical implementation roadmap
- Efficiency optimization strategies
- "How to execute" specifics

**üìä Gemini (Analysis Chief)** will provide:
- Data-driven market analysis
- Pattern recognition in similar platforms
- Technical deep-dive on scalability
- Systematic evaluation framework
- Comprehensive comparison matrix

**üîç Perplexity (Intelligence Chief)** will provide:
- Real-time research on competing platforms
- Current market trends in AI automation
- Latest developments in YouTube's policies
- Citations from industry sources
- Fact-based competitive analysis

**üí° SuperGrok Heavy 4 (Innovation Chief)** will provide:
- Bold, unconventional third options
- First-principles thinking on monetization
- Provocative challenges to both models
- Disruptive opportunities you're missing
- Contrarian takes with substance

## Expected Outcomes

### üéØ If All APIs Work Correctly
You should see 5 distinctly different responses:
- Claude: Strategic, thoughtful, considers ethics and systems
- GPT-5: Operational, step-by-step, action-oriented
- Gemini: Analytical, data-driven, comprehensive
- Perplexity: Research-backed, cited, current
- Grok: Bold, provocative, first-principles

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Detection
If any API fails, you'll see:
- Missing response from that chief
- Error message in console
- Graceful degradation (other chiefs still respond)

### üí∞ Cost Analysis
This question should cost approximately:
- **Total**: ~$0.05-0.10 for all 5 responses
- Claude: ~$0.02 (1-2K tokens)
- GPT-5: ~$0.01 (1K tokens)
- Gemini: **$0.00** (free tier!)
- Perplexity: ~$0.01 (1 search + tokens)
- Grok Heavy 4: ~$0.02 (1-2K tokens)

## Alternative Test Questions

### For Technical Capability Testing
**"My AI automation platform needs to process 10,000 videos/month. Should I use AWS Lambda, dedicated servers, or a hybrid approach? Consider costs, scalability, and latency."**

Why: Tests technical depth, cost analysis, real-world constraints

### For Strategic Depth Testing
**"I have $50,000 to invest. Should I spend it on marketing, hiring a technical co-founder, or building more features? I'm at 100 users and $5K MRR."**

Why: Tests strategic thinking, resource allocation, growth strategy

### For Real-Time Intelligence Testing
**"What are the latest YouTube automation tools in 2025, and which ones are getting the most traction? Which features should I prioritize based on market trends?"**

Why: Tests Perplexity's real-time search capabilities specifically

### For Innovation Testing
**"Everyone in AI content is focused on YouTube. What adjacent market is being completely ignored that I could dominate with the same technology?"**

Why: Tests Grok's contrarian thinking and first-principles innovation

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Review the responses** - Do they meet quality expectations?
2. **Check console for errors** - Any API issues?
3. **Verify costs** - Check API dashboard for actual usage
4. **Test individual chiefs** - Select one at a time
5. **Try collaboration mode** - See them debate each other
6. **Save successful sessions** - Export to JSON for reference
7. **Iterate on prompts** - Refine based on response quality
