### SCRIPT - FINAL APPROVED VERSION

#### [00:00 - 00:15] HOOK (15 seconds)
**[VISUAL: News headline "292,000 Federal Workers Laid Off"]**

"292,000 federal workers just lost their jobs in 2025. If you're one of them, I'm about to show you how to replace your government salary in 30 days using free AI tools. But you need to start TONIGHT."

**[Pause 2 seconds]**

---

#### [00:15 - 01:30] THE PAIN (75 seconds)
**[VISUAL: You on camera, empathetic expression]**

"I know what you're going through. One day you're a GS-12 with a pension track, the next you're scrolling LinkedIn at 2 AM wondering how you're going to pay your mortgage.

DOGE didn't just take your job. They took your identity. Your routine. Your sense of security.

But here's what they DIDN'T take: Your skills.

You spent years mastering complex regulations, managing projects, coordinating teams, writing reports that actually got read. Those skills? They're worth MORE in the private market than your GS salary ever was.

The problem is... nobody taught you how to package them."

**[VISUAL: Split screen - government badge on left, laptop with money symbols on right]**

---

#### [01:30 - 03:30] WHY AI CHANGES EVERYTHING (2 minutes)
**[VISUAL: Screen recording of ChatGPT interface]**

"Here's what changed in the last 18 months:

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini can now do 80% of the work that businesses used to hire full-time employees for.

That sounds scary. But it's actually your golden ticket.

Because YOU don't need to do the work manually anymore. You just need to know what to sell, and how to deliver it using AI.

Let me show you three services that ex-government workers are selling RIGHT NOW for $2,000 to $5,000 per client."

**[VISUAL: Numbered list appears on screen]**

---

#### [03:30 - 05:15] SERVICE #1 - AI POLICY WRITING (1:45 min)
**[VISUAL: Screen recording showing ChatGPT generating a policy document]**

"Service #1: AI-Powered Policy and Compliance Writing

Small businesses need employee handbooks, compliance policies, privacy policies, terms of service. But they can't afford a lawyer or consultant at $300/hour.

You? You spent YEARS writing federal regulations. You know exactly how policies should be structured.

Here's the process:
1. Client tells you what they need (example: remote work policy)
2. You use ChatGPT with this prompt: 'Create a comprehensive remote work policy for a 50-person tech startup, covering security, hours, equipment, and legal compliance'
3. It generates a draft in 30 seconds
4. You edit it for their specific situation (10 minutes of work)
5. You deliver a professional document they would have paid a lawyer $2,500 for

You charge: $500-$800 per policy
Your time investment: 20-30 minutes
Your effective hourly rate: $1,000-$2,400/hour

Former EPA policy analyst Sarah M. quit her job hunt after 2 weeks when she landed 3 clients at $600 each. That's $1,800 for 90 minutes of work."

---

#### [05:15 - 06:40] SERVICE #2 - AI VIRTUAL ASSISTANT (1:25 min)
**[VISUAL: Calendar, email, and task management interfaces]**

"Service #2: AI-Enhanced Virtual Assistant Services

Business owners are DROWNING in admin work. Email management, calendar scheduling, data entry, research.

You have executive assistant skills from coordinating across government agencies. Now you'll 10x your productivity with AI.

Here's what you offer:
- Email management: Use AI to draft responses, you just review and send
- Meeting scheduling: AI handles the back-and-forth
- Research and report generation: AI does the heavy lifting, you verify and format
- Data organization: AI categorizes and summarizes

You can serve 5-10 clients simultaneously because AI handles 80% of the grunt work.

Pricing: $1,500-$2,500/month per client
Time commitment: 2-3 hours per client per week
Total monthly income with 5 clients: $7,500-$12,500

Former VA administrator John started with ONE client on Upwork. He now has 7 clients and makes $14,000/month working 25 hours a week."

---

#### [06:40 - 07:50] SERVICE #3 - AI CONTENT FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES (70 sec)
**[VISUAL: Local business social media posts]**

"Service #3: AI Social Media Management for Local Businesses

Every restaurant, gym, real estate agent, and dental office needs social media content. But they don't have time to create it.

You become their content manager using AI:

1. Take 10 photos of their business on your phone
2. Use AI to write 30 social media posts per month
3. Use Canva + AI to create graphics
4. Schedule everything using free tools

Your clients get a professional social media presence.
You get: $800-$1,500/month per client
Your time: 2 hours per month per client

Former Parks & Rec coordinator Maria landed 4 local gyms in her first month. She makes $4,200/month for 8 hours of work total."

---

#### [07:50 - 08:30] CALL TO ACTION (40 seconds)

1. Pick ONE of these three services
2. Create a free ChatGPT account (link in description)
3. Practice the service on yourself or a friend

## DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

### LinkedIn (PRIMARY PLATFORM - Do this FIRST):
**Post Format**:
```
To the 292,000 federal workers laid off in 2025:

Your government skills translate directly to high-paying AI services.

Three former federal employees:
‚Ä¢ Sarah (EPA): $1,800 in 2 weeks
‚Ä¢ John (VA): $14,000/month
‚Ä¢ Maria (Parks): $4,200/month working 8 hours

They used the same free AI tools everyone has access to.

I just published a step-by-step video showing exactly how they did it.
