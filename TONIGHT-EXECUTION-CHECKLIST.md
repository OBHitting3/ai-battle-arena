  - Use rear camera (better quality)
  - Horizontal orientation (landscape)

- [ ] Webcam
  - Position at eye level (not looking down at you)

- [ ] DSLR/Mirrorless (if you have one)

**Lighting**:
- [ ] Best: Sit facing a window (natural light on your face)
- [ ] Backup: Use 2 desk lamps (one on each side of camera)
- [ ] Avoid: Overhead lighting (creates shadows)

**Alternative if camera shy**:

- [ ] No need to be on camera
- [ ] Still works, just less personal

**Practice**:
- [ ] Read through script once out loud
- [ ] Mark any words you stumble on
- [ ] Simplify those sentences
- [ ] Don't memorize - just be familiar

**Time check**: _______ (Should be Current + 60 min)

---

## HOUR 2-3: Recording (2 hours maximum)

### ‚úÖ Screen Recordings (30 minutes)

**You'll need B-roll of**:
- [ ] ChatGPT interface (chat.openai.com)
- [ ] Claude interface (claude.ai)
- [ ] You typing (screen recording of you doing anything - checking email, etc.)
- [ ] Canva interface (canva.com)

**How to screen record**:

**Mac**:
- Cmd + Shift + 5 ‚Üí Select area ‚Üí Record

**Windows**:
- Windows + G ‚Üí Click record button

**Steps**:

**Time check**: _______ (Should be Current + 90 min)

---

### ‚úÖ Main Video Recording (60-90 minutes)

**Setup**:
- [ ] Camera positioned and focused
- [ ] Lighting checked
- [ ] Audio tested
- [ ] Background clear
- [ ] Phone on silent
- [ ] Door closed / "Recording" sign up

**Recording Options**:

**OPTION A: Teleprompter Style** (Read script naturally)
- [ ] Open script on device near camera
- [ ] Read while maintaining eye contact with camera (glance at script)
- [ ] Speak conversationally, not like you're reading

**OPTION B: Section by Section** (Easier)
- [ ] Record just the HOOK (00:00-00:15)
- [ ] Stop
- [ ] Review
- [ ] If good, move to next section
- [ ] Repeat for each section
- [ ] Easier to get perfect, longer to edit

**OPTION C: One Take** (Fastest)
- [ ] Hit record
- [ ] Go through entire 8-minute script
- [ ] Mistakes are fine (cut them in editing)
- [ ] Raw and authentic

**My Recommendation**: Option C for video #1. Done > Perfect.

**Recording Tips**:
- Take a deep breath before you start
- Smile (even if you don't feel like it - it shows in your voice)
- Pause 2-3 seconds between sections (easier to edit)
- If you mess up, just pause, then start that sentence again (don't start over)
- Energy and authenticity > perfection

**Take Limit**: 3 maximum
- [ ] Take 1: Full run-through
- [ ] Watch back - how's the energy? Too stiff? Too low energy?
- [ ] Take 2: Adjust based on Take 1
- [ ] Pick best of two OR do Take 3 if needed

**DO NOT**:
- Do 10 takes trying to be perfect
- Obsess over every word
- Compare yourself to polished YouTubers (they have teams)

**Time check**: _______ (Should be Current + 150 min max)

---

## HOUR 4: Editing (60 minutes MAXIMUM)

### ‚úÖ Import to Editor (5 minutes)

**Easiest Options**:

- [ ] Import B-roll clips

**iMovie** (Mac users)
- [ ] Open iMovie
- [ ] Create new project
- [ ] Import clips

**DaVinci Resolve** (Free, more powerful, steeper learning curve)

**My Recommendation**: CapCut for video #1.

---

### ‚úÖ Basic Edit (45 minutes)

**Steps**:
1. [ ] **Cut dead air**
   - Remove long pauses (over 3 seconds)
   - Remove "um", "uh", awkward moments
   - Don't overdo it - some pauses are natural

2. [ ] **Insert B-roll**
   - When script says [VISUAL: ChatGPT], insert that screen recording
   - Overlay on top of main video OR cut to it
   - 5-10 seconds per B-roll clip

3. [ ] **Add captions** (CRITICAL for retention)
   - CapCut: Click "Text" ‚Üí "Auto captions"
   - Will auto-generate from your audio
   - Review for accuracy (AI makes mistakes)
   - Choose simple caption style (white text, black background)

4. [ ] **Simple intro** (Optional, 5 sec)
   - Text: "FedExit" logo
   - Fade in, fade out
   - Don't spend more than 5 minutes on this

5. [ ] **End screen** (10 sec)
   - Text: "Subscribe for more"
   - Text: "Comment if DOGE affected you"
   - Simple, clean

**DON'T**:
- Add fancy transitions (distracting)
- Use 10 different fonts (looks amateur)
- Add background music (competes with your voice)
- Spend 3 hours perfecting (diminishing returns)

**Time check**: _______ (Should be Current + 210 min)

### ‚úÖ Twitter/X Thread (10 minutes)

**Create a thread**:

```
1/ 292,000 federal workers just lost their jobs in 2025.

But 3 of them already replaced their income using free AI tools.

Here's exactly what they're doing (and how you can copy it): üßµ

2/ Sarah worked at the EPA making $72K.

She got laid off on a Tuesday.

By Friday, she had made $1,800.

Not from unemployment. From offering ONE service.

3/ AI-powered policy writing.

Small businesses need compliance documents, employee handbooks, privacy policies.

Sarah uses ChatGPT to generate drafts, then edits with her regulatory expertise.

$500-$800 per policy. 20-30 minutes of work.

4/ John was at the VA. Project manager. $78K/year.

He now offers "fractional PM services" to startups.

$2,500/month for 10 hours of work.

Uses AI to automate meeting notes, status updates, task management.

He has 5 clients. $12,500/month.

5/ Maria worked in Parks & Recreation. $65K/year.

Now runs social media for 4 local gyms.

AI writes the posts. She reviews and schedules.

$1,000/month per client = $4,000/month for 8 hours of work total.

6/ The pattern?

They're not replacing their JOBS.

They're replacing their INCOME.

Using skills they already have + AI tools that cost $0-$20/month.

7/ I broke down all 3 strategies in this video, including:

‚Ä¢ Exact AI prompts they use
‚Ä¢ How to find your first client
‚Ä¢ What to charge
‚Ä¢ How to deliver the work

8/ If you or someone you know was affected by the DOGE layoffs, this might help:

Your government career might be over.

But your income career is just beginning.

**r/fednews post**:

**Title**: "For anyone affected by the layoffs - resource on AI-based income alternatives"

**Body**:
```
I know this is an incredibly tough time for many folks here. I spent the last week researching how some former federal employees are using AI tools to transition to alternative income streams.

I found a few encouraging stories:
- Former EPA specialist offering AI-enhanced policy writing ($1,800 in first 2 weeks)
- Ex-VA project manager doing fractional PM work for startups ($12,500/month)
- Parks & Rec coordinator managing social media for local businesses ($4,200/month)

All using free or low-cost AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to augment their existing government skills.

I put together a breakdown of how they're doing it. Not trying to sell anything - just thought it might be helpful for anyone looking for alternatives while job searching.
